#                          GENERAL OUTLINE
#   Rene has four modes of renaming, native, regular expression (option -E) 
# substitution (option -S) and Undo (option -U). For native mode, the command 
# line is rene.py filter replacement rules options, with rules and options 
# being optional. For RE mode, it is rene.py filter replacement options, with 
# options being optional. For Sub and Undo, it is rene.py options. Undo 
# supports only one option, -U. Sub requires -S option and also supports 
# option -F, which provides file exclusion. Native and RE modes require filter 
# and replacement.
#   The command line is completely processed before looking at any files. 
# Syntactic and semantic errors are detected and either corrected or the 
# program exits. Incomplete rule and option parameters are initiallized to 
# default values. No command error checking is needed during the renaming 
# process.
#   Undo is simple. It reads the reneAct file, which records all renaming in 
# the last invocation and reverses the changes. This is done entirely in the 
# command parsing loop and then the program exits.
#   Except for Undo, renaming iterates over files in the current directory. 
# Recursion is not supported. Files and directories that don't meet filter 
# specs are skipped. An initial filter controlled by -F option applies to all 
# modes. Files that pass this are then processed according to one of the three 
# modes, Sub, native, and RE. The modes cannot be combined. They individually 
# apply their own filter while simultaneously computing a new name. After this 
# the modes converge onto a comman path where the new name is validated. 
# Nothing further is done if the name has not changed. If the new name is the 
# same as an existing one or one about to be created by renaming, collision 
# avoidance is engaged to systematically modify it until a collision-free name 
# is determined.
#   By default, all changes are display and the user asked whether to perform
# them. The -A (Act) option can change this to make the changes without asking
# or to only display the proposed changes.
#
#                            RULES AND OPTIONS
#   Rules and options have the same basic syntax except that options have - 
# prefix while rules all begin with a letter. For both, the first letter 
# identifies the type. Most have default values and may legally comprise only 
# that single letter. Parameters are alpha and numeric (decimal, hexadecimal, 
# or binary) strings divided into fields (where applicable) by /. Rules are 
# used only for native mode and only if the replacment contains rule 
# variables (? and :). The variables and rules are sequentially sychronized. 
# Most options apply to any mode. However, -U is its own complete mode. -O 
# applies only to native mode. Options and rules may appear anywhere in the 
# command line but, because of the synchronization between replacement and 
# rules, it is best for rules to appear immediately after replacement. 
# replacement must follow filter.
#   Regardless of where they appear in the command line, options are all 
# processed first because they can affect the preparation of the filter and 
# replacement. -E tells that they are standard regular expressions and not 
# native. -FC tells to make the filter case-insensitive. This information is 
# needed when the filter argument is compiled.
#
#                           INSERT-INCREMENT RULE
# Most rules are self-contained and statically defined in the repRules 
# dictionary after any changes to defaults by command arguments. The I rule is
# different. Its contribution to file names changes with each name that it is 
# applied to. For a single directory or normal recursion this can be simply 
# done by stepping the start value in the rule's descriptor. However, 
# sometimes we don't want continuous stepping but to reload the start value 
# for each directory. This requires the start value to stored in a hidden 
# reload value, which is copied back into the start value at each directory 
# transition. It would be simpler to use one global value for this but a 
# replacement might use more than one I rule and they would not be the same. 
# One might be continuous and the other reloaded and it is unlikely that they 
# would have the same start value. Also because of the possibility of multiple 
# I rules, the I rule processor itself can't reset a "new directory" flag set 
# by procTree. The only feasible solution is to have procTree find any I rules 
# in the rules list and reload the start value if requested in the command 
# argument (I////R). To make this a little more efficient, when the command 
# line is processed the indices of any I rules are added to the irules list. 
# If this is empty, procTree doesn't have to do anything, but it does reload 
# any that are listed and require reload. 
#
#                            DIRECTORY SORT
#   Windows directories are inherently case-insensitively sorted. Linux 
# directory contents are in random order. The results are identical unless the 
# native mode Insert-Increment rule is applied, as that increments the 
# insertion for each successive file. For consistent results in Linux, 
# directories are automatically sorted in this situation. A simple sort is 
# used. This does not exactly match Windows order because it is case-sensitive
# but it is adequate and  much less expensive than a case-insensitive sort.
#   That rene will normally process files in different order under Linux vs. 
# Windows is immaterial except under regression testing that verifies outcome 
# based on rene's output. For identical output, in Linux the directories must 
# be case-insensitively sorted. This is enabled by the test option -TS. -TS 
# overrides the simple sort used normally with Insert-Increment and may be 
# added to the commmand to force completely consistent results even when not 
# testing. See sortdir and getdir().
#
#                          COLLISION AVOIDANCE
#    If renaming (in any mode except Undo) a file produces a new name the same 
# as an existing file that is not the same one as being renamed (mainly a 
# Windows issue when only changing case) then collision avoidance (CA) is 
# engaged. 
#    CA modifies the new name in a specified way and checks this for 
# collision, repeating until there is no collision. The default scheme is to 
# append a number, starting at 0, to the root name, incrementing it as needed 
# to find a free name.
#    The command option -Xscheme specifies alternatives. scheme is a string, 
# without spaces, in which various characters independently control various 
# aspects of collision avoidance. S and C turn it off, with S saying to stop 
# immediately and C to contine, skipping the file. M tells to not append a 
# name fragment but to merge with the root by incrementing the numeric or 
# alphabetic tail of the root. Any other letter tells to use that as the 
# starting point (appended to the root). A number tells to use that as the 
# appended starting point. A string of punctuatiohs is added to the root, 
# identifying the name as not being exactly as requested, in addition to 
# participating in the avoidance process itself.
#

# regardless of the -P option to avoid cluttering the display with easily 
# predicted status.
#   After the initial file/directory filtering, if -FD contains excluded names
# and the name  matches then it is skipped. This is reported if -P requests 
# that skipped files be reported. There is no more filtering for option -S 
# (substitute). Native and RE (-E) modes additionally have their own filters. 
# Files that fail these are skipped (and reported if requested by -P).
#   -E and -S processes are very simple and embedded in the loop. Native mode 
# is much more complicated. It is implemented in the 'native' function in order
# to focus the loop block on operations shared by all three modes. -S and -E 
# modes raise the locally defined SkipFileException. native returns the new 
# name, which, if empty, causes SkipFileException to be raised. All further 
# processing is the same for all three modes. If the name is unchanged, nothing
# more is done (this can be reported by -P option). If the new name is the same
